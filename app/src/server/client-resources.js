// Per-client resource ownership.
//
// Everything under src/main/ was written for Electron main, where there is
// exactly ONE client (the renderer) and it dies with the process. The mobile
// server hands those same providers to MANY clients, any of which can vanish
// mid-flight and come back. Nothing in the provider layer has ever had a
// concept of a caller: `clientId` was computed by the transport, passed into
// router.call, and read by nobody. So a resource acquired on behalf of a client
// could not be attributed to it, and therefore could not be released when it
// went away.
//
// Measured on 2026-08-03 against real transcripts, six sessions viewed by
// clients that then vanished the way a phone does: rss 73MB -> 342MB, six
// permanently armed fs watchers and 5s pollers, and NOTHING released six
// seconds after every client was gone. Each stranded entry keeps re-reading its
// transcript forever, which is the other half of the same incident: a
// harbor-server run that burned 18 minutes of CPU in 20 minutes of wall clock
// and peaked at 6.4G, silently, with no log line of its own.
//
// This is deliberately a REGISTRY and not a repair inside transcript.js.
// `transcript:open` is merely the first method that acquires per-client state;
// the next one to be added would have exactly the same hole. A method that
// acquires registers a releaser here and gets teardown for free.
//
// It also closes a second hole in the same shape: releases are checked against
// what the CALLER holds, so one client can no longer close a transcript another
// client opened (which decremented the owner's refcount and stranded it).
//
// Part of /home/you/dev/harbor (see README.md).
