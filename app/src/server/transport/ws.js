// A per-client outbound queue, bounded by BOTH item count and BYTES.
//
// The item count alone was never a memory bound. A `transcript:update` replace
// payload measures 0.19 to 0.50 MB against Pat's real transcripts, so 256 of
// them is ~125MB retained for ONE client that has stopped draining, and a phone
// that walks out of range without a close frame stops draining permanently.
//
// Payloads are serialized ON ENQUEUE rather than in pump(). That is what makes
// the byte accounting exact instead of estimated, and it removes the second
// stringify that used to happen at send time. The tradeoff is a wasted
// serialize for a frame that is later evicted; frames are the small payloads
// (a screen of ANSI), so the trade is worth it in both directions.
// Which pushes supersede their own predecessors, and what identifies "their
// own". A transcript update is per SESSION, so two sessions updating must not
// collapse into one; the sidebar is a single global snapshot. Every other
// channel returns null and keeps today's append-only behaviour, deliberately:
// `send:status` is a sequence of distinct events, and terminal frames already
// have their own eviction rule.
// ONLY A WHOLE-STATE PAYLOAD MAY SUPERSEDE ITS PREDECESSOR, and `transcript:update`
// is not always one (live-caught by Pat on his phone, 2026-08-07).
//
// The channel carries TWO shapes. `{ replace: blocks }` is the full live block
// list and a newer one genuinely makes an older one redundant. But
// `{ append: [...], changed: [...] }` is a DELTA, emitted by
// providers/transcript.js when new blocks arrive, which is precisely what
// happens when a message is sent. Coalescing those dropped the earlier append
// on the floor: Pat sent a second message about fifteen seconds after the
// first, the queue replaced append A with append B, and the blocks in A were
// never delivered to that client at all. The message HAD landed, so it was in
// the transcript and showed on desktop (which is on IPC and never coalesces);
// on the phone it simply never appeared, and no later event repaired it,
// because an append is only ever sent once.
//
// The flood this was built for is unaffected: the burst measured at 48 updates
// in 20 seconds is the watcher's belt poll re-emitting `replace`, and those
// still collapse to one slot.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The browser `WebSocket` constructor is NOT subject to the same-origin
// policy: any page the phone's owner happens to have open in another tab can
// run `new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:8787/ws')` (or the tailnet equivalent),
// and the browser will connect using whatever network position it already
// has, with no prompt and no CORS preflight. The bearer-token check further
// down still gates every MUTATING method, but `remote-safe` methods
// (`sidebar:get-state`, `transcript:open`, ...) require nothing at all by
// design, so without an Origin check any web page the owner visits is a free
// read of every project name, session id, and full conversation transcript
// on the machine. This is checked on the UPGRADE, before `wss.handleUpgrade`
// runs, exactly like the pathname check just above it: a socket that never
// should have been accepted is destroyed before it becomes a live connection.
//
// This is deliberately independent of `assertSafeBind`/the token/tailnet
// auth. Bind address restricts WHERE this process listens; Origin restricts
// WHO is allowed to have asked, which bind address cannot see at all (a
// request that reached this handler already passed the bind check, since the
// socket could not otherwise exist).
//
// The allowlist is the server's OWN origins, derived from the live socket
// rather than hardcoded: `server.address()` returns exactly the host/port
// this process is actually bound to (already vetted by `assertSafeBind`
// before `listen()` ever ran, so trusting it here adds no new exposure), plus
// the fixed loopback aliases a browser may use to reach that same bind
// (127.0.0.1 / localhost / ::1 do not appear in `server.address()` when bound
// to one specific form of it), plus any `selfOriginHosts` the composition
// root discovered belong to this node by another route (setup/mobile.md's
// recommended phone setup fronts a loopback bind with `tailscale serve`,
// which terminates HTTPS at the tailnet's MagicDNS name on port 443, a
// different host AND port than the one this process is listening on, so a
// bind-only check would refuse that exact documented flow).
//
// A MISSING Origin header IS ALLOWED, and that is load-bearing, not an
// oversight: a real browser ALWAYS sends Origin on a WebSocket handshake
// (there is no way for page JS to suppress it), so the attack this guards
// against is impossible without one. Non-browser clients (curl, a native
// app, some installed/standalone PWA shells) send no Origin at all, and
// refusing them would break those legitimate clients while blocking nothing
// a browser-based attacker could not already be blocked from some other way.
// Do NOT "harden" this to require Origin; that trades a real phone for
