// A NEW SESSION IS EITHER USABLE OR IT SAYS WHAT IT NEEDS. Never a silent dead
// end. This is the gate whose absence let 2026-08-06 happen.
//
// Pat started a session, sent /acclimate twice, and got nothing either time.
// Claude had opened on its first-run notice chain ("Press Enter to continue…")
// and never reached a composer, so the sends had nowhere to land. Every suite
// was green while the only thing he actually does was broken, because:
//
//   - `waitForClaudeReady` is called from ONE place and only when a preset
//     command follows the launch. A plain new session has no readiness check.
//   - When it IS called, a blocked screen makes it `continue`, so a first-run
//     gate spins out the full timeout and returns false silently.
//   - The one test in this repo that drives a REAL claude is gated on
//     HARBOR_RUN_LIVE_CLAUDE, which no script sets. It had never run. That is
//     the same disease as the HARBOR_BROWSER_TESTS suite deleted the same day:
//     a test that cannot run is not coverage, it is the appearance of coverage.
//
// So this spec drives a REAL claude binary through the REAL getMenu path and
// asserts the invariant a human cares about. It sends no message, so it costs
// no tokens, which is why it can run in the ordinary gate instead of behind an
// opt-in nobody sets.
//
// It deliberately does NOT assert "always reaches a composer": a genuine choice
// (the trust dialog, the theme picker) legitimately needs a human. What it
// forbids is the state Pat hit, where Harbor is waiting on something only it
// can clear and shows the user nothing they can act on.
